 # Such a sharing would require additional protocol e.g. to lock a document to
 # support concurrent editing.

 # ELS as implemented here assumes server sharing be possible, especially when
 # debugging the els server functionality, an els process would be started from
 # the command line before an els client embedded in a VSCode instance is
 # started.
